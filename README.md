Minecraft Manager v1.0

I finaly got tired of backing up game data and changing launchers so here is an application that does it for you. This application only currently works on windows. As I get my linux box set up I will extend support to linux as well. Currently working on Windows 8.1.

Please keep in mind this application is a work in progress at the moment. Not all (most) features are not working. If you would like to express your intrest in the project and show that this is really a project people want please dontate to one of the addresses below.
